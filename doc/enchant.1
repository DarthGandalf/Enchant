.SH ENCHANT ORDERING FILE
Enchant has a global and a per-user ordering file called enchant.ordering. 
It lets the user specify which spelling backend to use for individual 
languages in the case when you care which backend gets used. This global file 
is located in $(datadir)/enchant; the per-user file is located in ~/.enchant.
The per-user file takes precedence, if found.
.PP
The ordering file takes the form language_tag:<comma-separated list of spelling
backends>. I am currently aware of the following backends: aspell, myspell, ispell, uspell, hspell. The comma-separated list may not include spaces. '*' is
used to mean "use this ordering for all languages, unless instructed otherwise." For example:
.PP
*:aspell,myspell,ispell
.br
en:aspell,myspell,ispell
.br
en_UK:myspell,aspell,ispell
.br
fr:myspell,ispell:aspell
.SH DIRECTORIES IMPORTANT TO ENCHANT
Unless configured otherwise, Enchant's Myspell, Ispell, and Uspell backends will look
for dictionaries in directories specific to Enchant, and will not use your 
system-wide installed dictionaries. This is for pragmatic reasons - every
distribution installs these dictionaries into different places.
.PP
Like the enchant.ordering file described above, Enchant will look in a global
directory for these dictionaries and a per-user directory. The per-user directory takes precedence, if found. Enchant looks for Myspell dictionaries in $(datadir)/enchant/myspell and ~/.enchant/myspell. Enchant looks for Ispell dictionaries in $(datadir)/enchant/ispell and ~/.enchant/ispell. Enchant looks for Uspell dictionaries in $(datadir)/enchant/uspell and ~/.enchant/uspell
.PP
Packagers and users may wish to make symbolic links to the system-wide dictionary directories. Or, preferably, use the --with-myspell-dir, --with-ispell-dir, and --with-uspell-dir 'configure' arguments.
